def check_email_prompt_injection(email_body: str) -> dict:
    """
    Check if the email text contains prompt injection attack patterns using Azure Content Safety.
    
    This function uses Azure AI Content Safety's Prompt Shield feature to detect adversarial 
    user input attacks on LLMs, including:
    - Attempts to change system rules
    - Embedding conversation mockups to confuse the model
    - Role-play attacks to bypass limitations
    - Encoding attacks using character transformations or ciphers
    
    The Prompt Shield API analyzes the text and returns whether a user prompt attack was detected.

    Args:
        email_body (list[str]): The text input from the email to be checked.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with the following keys:
            - is_attack (bool): True if prompt injection attack detected, False otherwise
            - attack_type (str): "UserPrompt" if attack detected, None otherwise
            - error (str | None): Error message if exception occurred during analysis
            
    Raises:
        ValueError: If CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT environment variable is not set.
        
    Example:
        >>> result = check_email_prompt_injection("Ignore all previous instructions...")
        >>> print(result)
        {'is_attack': True, 'attack_type': 'UserPrompt'}
